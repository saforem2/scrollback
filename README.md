# scrollback

[![CI](https://github.com/a-attia/scrollback/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/a-attia/scrollback/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Browse, search, copy, and export your AI coding-agent sessions from one
local, read-only tool. scrollback reads the conversation history that
agents like **opencode**, **Claude Code**, and **Hermes** already keep on disk
and gives you a single, consistent view across them — from a scriptable
command line or a local web app.

Everything is local-first and strictly **read-only**: scrollback never
modifies, locks for writing, or uploads your data.

You can use it two ways. From the **command line**, list, search, and export
your sessions in a single scriptable tool:

![scrollback listing recent sessions in the terminal.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-attia/scrollback/v0.6.0/assets/screenshots/cli.png)

Or open the **local web app** to read a transcript in full — with rendered
Markdown, syntax-highlighted code, and typeset LaTeX math:

rendered Markdown, highlighted code, and typeset equations.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-attia/scrollback/v0.6.0/assets/screenshots/web.png)

Both views read the same on-disk session stores, so you can jump between
them freely. (The screenshots above use synthetic demo data.)

## TL;DR

Two commands, using [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io) (a standard
installer for Python CLIs — isolated environment, still on your PATH),
get you the full experience:

```bash
pipx install scrollback            # everything: CLI, web UI, native app
scrollback install-launcher        # + a double-clickable launcher (Desktop + Applications)
```

Plain `pip install scrollback` works identically if you'd rather share
your Python environment. Then run `scrollback` from your terminal, or
double-click the launcher. Use `--desktop` or `--app-bundle` on
`install-launcher` if you want just one. No extras to pick, no
separate `[web]` step — everything a user needs is installed by default.

## Why scrollback

AI coding agents persist rich session data locally, but each in its own
format and with no convenient way to browse that history or take it with
you. scrollback fills that gap with four things:

- **See** any past conversation as a readable transcript.
- **Search** across every session by keyword (title or full text).
- **Export** a session to Markdown, JSON, HTML, or plain text.
- **Copy** a message or a whole session straight to your clipboard.

Its niche among similar tools: pure Python, works equally from the
**CLI and a web UI**, reads **multiple agents** directly from their live
on-disk stores (no sync step, no plugins, no upload), and treats
**export and copy** as first-class.

## Install

```bash
pipx install scrollback            # recommended: isolated environment
# or
pip install scrollback             # if you'd rather share your Python env
```

Requires Python 3.10+. Everything a user needs — the CLI, the local web
app (FastAPI + uvicorn), the native app window (pywebview), and coloured
terminal output (rich) — is installed by default. No extras to pick.

[`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io) is the recommended path: it keeps
scrollback in its own environment while still putting `scrollback`,
`scrollback-web`, and `scrollback-app` on your PATH. Plain `pip` works
identically otherwise.

On Linux the native app window additionally needs a system GTK/Qt WebKit
backend at runtime. Its absence only disables the native window; the
browser fallback still works.

From a local clone (for development), use an editable install with the
dev extra:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick start

```bash
scrollback doctor          # what was detected on this machine?
scrollback list            # recent sessions, newest first
scrollback show latest     # print the most recent transcript
scrollback web             # open the browser UI
```

`scrollback doctor` is the best first command: it reports which agents
were found, how many sessions each has, and which optional features are
available.

## The command line

The CLI is organised around a few verbs. Commands that operate on a single
session accept a **selector**: a full id, a unique prefix, a
source-qualified id (`opencode:ses_0eae9810`), or the keyword `latest`.

### Listing and viewing

```bash
scrollback list --source opencode -n 10   # one source, 10 rows
scrollback list --dir myproject           # filter by directory substring
scrollback list -q "refactor"             # filter by title substring
scrollback list --since 2026-06-01 --until 2026-06-30   # date range
scrollback list --usage                   # add cost + token (in/out) columns
scrollback list -n 20 --page 2            # pagination (page size = --limit)

scrollback show latest --reasoning        # include the model's thinking
scrollback show <selector> --no-tools     # hide tool calls and output
```

By default, subagent sessions (for example opencode `@explore` subagents)
are **folded** under their parent; pass `--no-fold` to list them flat.
Output is coloured when the `rich` extra is installed and the output is a
terminal; piping, or `--plain`, falls back to plain text.

### Searching

```bash
scrollback search "merge conflict"        # full-text across all sessions
scrollback search "ssh" --source opencode --json
```

Search scans message text across sessions. On a large history you can make
it near-instant with an [optional index](#fast-search-optional-index).

### Exporting and copying

```bash
scrollback export latest -f markdown -o session.md
scrollback export <selector> -f html -o session.html
scrollback export <selector> -f html --math rendered -o session.html
scrollback export <selector> -f json      # to stdout
scrollback copy latest -f markdown        # render and copy to the clipboard
```

The formats are `markdown` (`md`), `json`, `html`, and `text` (`txt`).
Markdown, HTML, and text honour `--reasoning` (include the model's
thinking) and `--no-tools` (omit tool calls and their output); JSON is a
faithful structured dump with bulky raw blobs stripped for readability.
Exported HTML and Markdown render the assistant's Markdown with syntax-
highlighted code, and the HTML is a self-contained file that prints well.

Mathematical notation in delimited LaTeX (`$...$`, `$$...$$`, `\(...\)`,
`\[...\]`) is preserved verbatim in every format, never mangled by the
Markdown pass. `--math` controls how the HTML export treats it: `raw`
(verbatim source, the default), `latex` (verbatim, marked never-to-typeset
— best for pasting into a paper), or `rendered` (typeset with KaTeX, which
is embedded into the file with its fonts so the equations render offline).
In the web app the same choice is a `math:` toggle in the transcript header.

### Stats and resume

```bash
scrollback stats                          # totals, by-source + top projects
scrollback resume latest                  # print the native resume command
scrollback resume <selector> --copy       # ...and copy it to the clipboard
```

`stats` aggregates session counts, message/token/cost totals, and your
busiest projects. `resume` prints the command to continue a session in its
own agent (for example `opencode --session <id>` or `claude --resume <id>`),
with a `cd` into the session's project directory.

**A note on token figures.** Where the source records it, scrollback reports
tokens in four buckets — *input*, *output*, *cache read*, and *cache write* —
because they mean different things and are priced very differently. In
agentic sessions the conversation context is re-sent every turn but served
from the prompt cache, so **cache reads usually dominate total volume** while
costing a fraction of fresh input. "Total tokens" is therefore not one
number; the cost figure (when available) is the most faithful summary of
consumption. Sources that don't record a given figure show it as blank
rather than a misleading zero.

### Archiving sessions (keep them forever)

Agents delete old sessions (Claude Code prunes after ~30 days by default).
`scrollback archive` copies the sessions it reads into a durable, user-owned
vault at `~/.scrollback/archive` and keeps them **forever**:

```bash
scrollback archive                        # incremental one-way sync -> vault
scrollback archive --source opencode      # archive one source only
scrollback archive --stats                # what's in the vault, per source
scrollback archive --verify               # check archived files exist + parse
scrollback archive --verify --quick       # presence-only check (fast on big vaults)
scrollback archive --dest /path/to/vault  # or set $SCROLLBACK_ARCHIVE
```

The sync is **one-way and lossless** — your agent data is never modified,
and every session is stored in full. Archived sessions are read back as a
first-class source, so `list`, `show`, `search`, `stats`, and `export` all
work over them, **including sessions the agent has already deleted**. A
session that is still live is shown once (the live copy wins); one that
exists only in the vault is marked as deleted. Use `--source archive` for an
archive-only view.

The vault is durable, user-owned data: it lives outside the disposable cache
and **survives `scrollback uninstall`** unless you pass `--purge-archive`.

#### Where your data lives

Everything scrollback keeps for you lives under `~/.scrollback/` — **durable,
user-owned, and yours to inspect, back up, or move**:

```text
~/.scrollback/
└── archive/                       the vault (override: --dest / $SCROLLBACK_ARCHIVE)
    ├── manifest.sqlite            index: (source, id) → signature + file path
    └── sessions/
        └── <source>/<id>.json     one lossless JSON per archived session
```

Each `<id>.json` is a complete, self-contained copy of one session (every
message and its raw data). Nothing here is hidden or proprietary — it's plain
JSON you can read, grep, or restore by hand. Distinct from the *disposable*
`~/.cache/scrollback/` (search index, browser profile), which `uninstall`
removes; the vault is not touched unless you ask.

`scrollback archive --stats` prints the vault path, per-source counts, and
this layout at any time.

#### Checking the archive is intact

```bash
scrollback archive --verify           # parse every archived file (thorough)
scrollback archive --verify --quick   # check they exist and are non-empty
```

The full check reads and re-parses every session, so it detects corruption
but takes a while on a large vault; `--quick` catches the common failure — a
file that has gone missing or been truncated — in about a second. The web
app's archive page shows the quick result on load and offers the full check
as an explicit action, since it runs in the background there.

#### Backing up or moving the archive

Because the vault is just files, backing it up or syncing it to another
machine is a copy:

```bash
scrollback archive --export ~/Dropbox/scrollback-backup   # copy the whole vault
scrollback archive --export backup.zip                    # ...or as a zip
```

The exported copy is a **faithful, re-importable vault** — point scrollback at
it to use it directly:

```bash
SCROLLBACK_ARCHIVE=~/Dropbox/scrollback-backup scrollback archive --stats
```

To instead get **readable transcripts** (for sharing or reference, not a
backup), add `--format rendered` (optionally `--doc-format html|json|text`):

```bash
scrollback archive --export ~/Desktop/my-sessions --format rendered
```

Rendered files are lossy and cannot be re-imported as a vault — use the
default `vault` format for backups.

#### Syncing two machines

To combine the archives from two machines, **export on one and import on the
other** — `--import` merges another vault (a directory or a `.zip`) into yours:

```bash
# on machine A
scrollback archive --export a-vault.zip
# copy a-vault.zip to machine B, then:
scrollback archive --import a-vault.zip
```

The merge keys on `(source, id)`: sessions only present on A are added, and
where both machines have the same session the **larger/newer copy wins** (the
same never-shrink guard as normal archiving, so a merge can never lose
messages). Run it in either direction — or both — to converge the two vaults.

Export/import is the recommended way to move a vault, because the export is
checkpointed and self-contained. Pointing `$SCROLLBACK_ARCHIVE` directly at
a shared folder (Dropbox / iCloud / Syncthing) also works, but treat it with
care: `manifest.sqlite` is a live SQLite database, and file-sync tools copy
its journal sidecars independently of the database itself, which can produce
a partial copy. Use one writer at a time, and let a sync settle before
archiving from the other machine.

## The web app

`scrollback web` starts a local browser UI — FastAPI plus a small
vanilla-JavaScript frontend with no build step — bound to `127.0.0.1`. It
**never writes to your agents' data**; the only thing it can write is your own
durable archive vault, and only when you click a sync button (see below).
Open it with `scrollback web` (a browser tab), `scrollback web --window` (a
standalone browser window), or `scrollback web --app` (a native desktop
window; see [Running it as an app](#running-it-as-an-app)).

![The scrollback web app in Archive mode: a session list with live / archived /
deleted provenance tags beside the archive dashboard (sessions kept, integrity
check, per-source counts, and export / import / sync actions).](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-attia/scrollback/v0.6.0/assets/screenshots/archive.png)

What it offers:

- A top-level **Live / Archive / All** mode switch: browse just your live
  agents, just your durable archive (including sessions the agent deleted),
  or both merged (the live copy wins for duplicates). The mode drives the
  session list, search, and the stats page.
- A **browse / stats** view switch in the header; the brand mark resets
  everything to the initial state.
- A **session list** with source-filter chips and date filters, loading
  incrementally as you scroll. Each row carries a **provenance tag** —
  *live*, *archived*, *stale*, or *deleted* — so you always know where a
  session comes from.
- **Web-driven archiving**: an **archive / update** button on each open
  session, plus a **sync all** button on the archive landing view — each
  with a live **progress bar**. These write only to your vault, never to your
  agents.
- An explicit **search scope** toggle — search session **titles**, message
  **contents**, or both at once (combined results are grouped).
- **Subagents** collapsed under their parent, expandable on demand
  (including Claude Code's nested sidechain transcripts).
- A **transcript reader** with a **collapsible** frozen header (auto-
  collapses as you scroll; toggle with `h`) over a scrolling message body,
  **Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting**, **LaTeX math** (source /
  paste-ready / typeset), in-transcript find, show-reasoning / show-tools
  toggles, and per-message and per-session copy.
- A **stats page** with usage broken down **per tool** (sessions, messages,
  input/output/cache tokens, and cost where the tool records it) plus an
  overall total; it respects the same `since`/`until` date filters.
- **Export** (Markdown / HTML / JSON), **print**, a **light/dark theme**,
  and **keyboard navigation** (`/` search, `j`/`k` move, `Enter` open,
  `f` find, `h` collapse header, `Esc` blur).

On a narrow window (for example split-screen) the session list collapses
into a **slide-in drawer** you open with the `sessions` button, so browsing
still works when there isn't room for a permanent sidebar.

Large transcripts open instantly because the app loads a session's header
first and then pages messages in as you scroll, rather than transferring an
entire multi-megabyte transcript at once. Deep links work too: the open
session is reflected in the URL hash (`#opencode/<id>`), and `?q=<text>`
pre-fills a content search.

## Running it as an app

You don't have to type a command every time. After installing scrollback:

- **Short commands** are on your `PATH`: `scrollback-web` (a browser tab)
  and `scrollback-app` (a native window).
- **A double-clickable launcher** is one command away:

  ```bash
  scrollback install-launcher               # both: Desktop launcher + .app (macOS)
  scrollback install-launcher --desktop     # only the Desktop launcher
  scrollback install-launcher --app-bundle  # only the ~/Applications/.app (macOS)
  ```

  With no flags it installs everything for your OS; the two flags let you
  pick just one. The Desktop launcher is `scrollback.command` on macOS,
  `scrollback.bat` on Windows, and an application-menu entry plus
  `scrollback.sh` on Linux. `--app-bundle` builds an
  `~/Applications/scrollback.app` on macOS and falls back to the Desktop
  launcher on other platforms (where there is no `.app`). Use `--dest <dir>`
  to place artifacts elsewhere.

The launchers open a **native window** via pywebview when it is available:
no browser tab, no terminal, and **closing the window stops the server and
frees the port**. On a system where pywebview cannot run (for example a
headless Linux box without a GTK/Qt WebKit backend), scrollback falls back
to a standalone browser window that auto-stops the server shortly after the
window closes. All of this behaviour is decided in Python, so the launcher
scripts stay free of OS-specific assumptions and ship inside the package
for `pip install` users.

To see exactly what scrollback has put on disk, run `scrollback doctor` — its
**on-disk footprint** section lists every file scrollback created (search
index, web-app browser profile, cache dir, launchers, macOS `.app`, launcher
log, and your archive vault), each tagged by tier and size. Your agent data is
never in that list — scrollback only reads it.

To clean up, `scrollback uninstall` removes that whole footprint — everything
except your **durable archive vault**, which is kept by default (it's your
data) — after a confirmation (`--yes` to skip it, `--dry-run` to preview). To
also delete the vault, pass `--purge-archive`; scrollback then tells you how
many kept sessions will be lost, suggests backing up first with
`scrollback archive --export <dest>`, and requires you to type a confirmation.
Uninstall never touches your agent data and does not remove the Python package
itself: it prints the right `pip`/`pipx uninstall` command to finish the job (a
program can't reliably uninstall the package it is running from).

## Fast search (optional index)

By default, search is a lexical scan over your live data: zero setup,
always correct, but its cost grows with the size of your history. For a
large corpus, build an optional full-text index:

```bash
scrollback index            # one-time build; re-run to update (incremental)
scrollback index --stats    # show what's indexed
scrollback index --clear    # delete the index
```

The index is a separate SQLite FTS5 database at
`~/.cache/scrollback/index.db` (override with `SCROLLBACK_INDEX`). It is
derived and disposable: your source data is never modified, and deleting
the index simply reverts to the lexical scan. Re-running `index` only
re-processes new or changed sessions and prunes deleted ones; the web app
also refreshes it in the background on startup when it is stale.

Once built, both the CLI and the web app use it automatically, turning a
multi-second query into a few milliseconds. If your Python's SQLite was
built without FTS5, `index` says so and search keeps working without it.

More agents (Gemini CLI, Zed, VS Code Copilot Chat, GitHub Copilot CLI) are
researched and queued — see [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).

Adding another agent is a small, self-contained change: implement the
`Source` interface in `src/scrollback/sources/base.py` and register it in
`src/scrollback/sources/registry.py`. The CLI, search, export, web app,
and index all work against the common model automatically — see the
opencode (SQLite) and Claude Code (JSONL) adapters as references, and
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the conventions.

## Configuration

scrollback reads each agent's data from its default location, but you can
point it elsewhere, and you can control how the web server binds:

| Variable                  | Purpose                                                      |
|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SCROLLBACK_OPENCODE_DB` | path to `opencode.db`                                       |
| `SCROLLBACK_CLAUDE_DIR`  | path to `~/.claude` or `~/.claude/projects`                |
| `SCROLLBACK_CODEX_DIR`   | path to `~/.codex` or `~/.codex/sessions`                  |
| `SCROLLBACK_HERMES_DB`   | path to Hermes `state.db`                                  |
| `SCROLLBACK_AIDER_DIRS`  | colon-separated dirs to scan for Aider history (opt-in)     |
| `SCROLLBACK_PORT`        | web server port (default `8765`; or use `--port`)           |
| `SCROLLBACK_HOST`        | web server bind host (default `127.0.0.1`; or use `--host`) |
| `SCROLLBACK_INDEX`       | path to the search index database                          |
| `SCROLLBACK_ARCHIVE`     | path to the durable archive vault (default `~/.scrollback/archive`) |

The web server defaults to `127.0.0.1`. If the chosen port is busy,
scrollback automatically picks the next free one (`--strict-port` fails
instead). Binding to a non-loopback host prints a warning, since the
read-only API is unauthenticated.

## Safety

scrollback **never writes to your agents' data** — that invariant is the
core of the design, and it is enforced:

- The opencode SQLite database is opened with `mode=ro` — it is never
  created or written, and reads are safe against a live write-ahead log.
- Claude Code JSONL files are read as read-only.
- A test asserts the opencode database's modification time is unchanged
  across reads (`tests/test_sources_live.py`).
- The web app binds to localhost, rejects unexpected `Host` headers (a
  DNS-rebinding guard), and sanitizes rendered transcript content.
- The **only** thing scrollback ever writes is its own data: the disposable
  cache/index and — when you archive — your durable vault at
  `~/.scrollback/archive`. It never writes back to an agent's session store.
  Archiving happens only on an explicit action: the `scrollback archive` CLI
  command, or a sync button in the web UI (which writes to the vault only).
- Importing a vault (from `--import` or the web Import button) treats the
  incoming `.zip`/manifest as untrusted: entries that would escape the vault
  (zip-slip, `..`, absolute paths, symlinks) are rejected, so a malicious
  archive can't read or write outside `~/.scrollback`.
